Hi!


Start the virtual env with source venv/bin/activate

Install packages with pip install -r requirements.txt

2 ways to run the app locally

1. python app.py

2.
  If you are using a bash terminal:
    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    flask run

  If you are using windows command prompt
    set FLASK_APP=app.py
    flask run

Neat right?
See you at hackbu on Thursdays at 8pm
