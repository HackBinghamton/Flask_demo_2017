Hi!


Start the virtual env with source venv/bin/activate

Install packages with pip install -r requirements.txt

2 ways to run the app locally

`python app.py`

OR

  If you are using a bash terminal:
    `export FLASK_APP=app.py`
    `flask run`

  If you are using windows command prompt
    `set FLASK_APP=app.py`
    `flask run`

Neat right?
See you at hackbu on Thursdays at 8pm
